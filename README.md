# MultiStory
Creating a multi-pronged timeline for history from marginalized perspectives. 

## Getting started 

Go to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pvig2SS3qYtAN36fMT38Os3749pRIkz0kDrJY3i849Y/edit?usp=sharing). All events for the original iteration of this assignment have already been created. Add text in the 'text' column, making sure to put it in the right row. Add any media in the corresponding rows. Please don't change the "type"; this column just delineates which slide is the title slide. You can use hex codes in the "background" column to add a pop of color!

Note: the link above is the editing link. If you want to preview the timeline without going through the github link, navigate to [this link](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#make-step-3) and enter this link in the box: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pvig2SS3qYtAN36fMT38Os3749pRIkz0kDrJY3i849Y/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pvig2SS3qYtAN36fMT38Os3749pRIkz0kDrJY3i849Y/edit#gid=0)

Here's the [original documentation](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make) for the beginner version of TimelineJS.
